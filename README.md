## Prime Factors Kata

### Kata

Factorize a positive integer into its prime factors.

For example:

2 -> [2]

3 -> [3]

4 -> [2,2]

6 -> [2,3]

9 -> [3,3]

12 -> [2,2,3]

15 -> [3,5]

### Randori Rules

1. There's an active Driver/Navigator pair that writes the code.
2. The rest of the room actively pays attention and is able to make suggestions when appropiate
3. After 5 minutes the Navigator becomes the Driver, and the driver goes back with the rest of the room
